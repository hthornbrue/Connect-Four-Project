Allows for 2 players to play the game "Connect Four" back and forth against each other with player 1 being the "Yellow Team" and player 2 being the "Red Team". Once a player is able to get four of the same color chips in a row on the board either vertically, horizontally, or diagonally in either direction, they win the game.
